<i>Abstract</i>: The progenitor nature of superluminous supernovae, events in which the radiated
energy is 100 times higher than in normal supernovae, is a highly-debated topic. SN 2006gy is one
of the first observed superluminous supernovae, in which the spectrum showed narrow hydrogen lines
implying interaction with a circumstellar medium. Although the nature of this event remains unclear,
it was recently proposed that a standard type Ia supernova hitting with a shell of circumstellar
medium can produce a light curve matching the observations. In this work, we explore this scenario
by evolving a grid of isolated binaries of different initial masses and orbital periods, using the
publicly-available stellar-evolution code MESA. We follow the evolution of both stars from their
initial stages in the main-sequence until the formation of a white-dwarf orbiting around a massive
donor star. We map the initial binary parameter space able to produce these systems, estimate rates
of SN 2006gy-like events and study the dependence of our predicted rates with respect to the mass of
the circumstellar medium.
