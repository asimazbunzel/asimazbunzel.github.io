<i>Abstract</i>: Since the first gravitational waves detections of mergers between black holes observed with LIGO-Virgo detectors, the study of the evolutionary scenarios which leads towards the formation of such systems has become essential. In this seminar I will present results of our recent work on the progenitor population of the two lowest-mass binary black hole mergers detected during the first two observing runs of LIGO-Virgo: GW151226 and GW170608. I will also present estimates on the expected merger rates for these events and show the role of the mass-transfer efficiency and metallicity of the population.
