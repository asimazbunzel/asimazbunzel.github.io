*Abstract*: The majority of massive stars live in binary or multiple systems and will interact
during their lifetimes, which helps to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae.
Donor stars in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass transfer,
which not only affects the surface properties, but also the core structure. However, most
calculations of the core-collapse properties of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present
a systematic study of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and stars
of the same initial mass (11 - 21 M$$_\odot$$) that have been stripped due to stable post-main
sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present the pre-supernova core composition with novel
diagrams that give an intuitive representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous
studies, at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain an extended
gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer originates from the receding of the convective helium
core during core helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star models.
We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences in the final density and
nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped star models have systematically higher total
masses of carbon at the moment of core collapse compared to single star models, which likely results
in systematically different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning and
oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications of our findings for
the explodability, supernova observations, and nucleosynthesis from these stars. Our models will be
publicly available and can be readily used as input for supernova simulations.

## 1. Intro

Massive stars are found in binaries, interaction becomes **almost** unavoidable (Sana et al., etc.).
The final outcome would then be different to a single massive star, something very important for
e.g., the population of compact-objects binaries. **However, most of current studies do not consider
binary evolution but rather a pure He-star or removing mass through a wind sometime in the evolution
of single stars**. Also, binary studies stops much earlier in the evolution: typically at core C
depletion, with a little nuclear reaction network due to computational limits.

This work: detailed evolution of single and binaries with masses 11 - 21 M$$_\odot$$, until core
collapse, with a 128 isotopes nuclear reaction network.

Aim: comparison of pre-collapse interior structures, composition. Implications, limitations, ...

## 2. Method

Evolution with $${\tt MESA}$$:

* single stars between 11 - 21 M$$_\odot$$
* close binaries with primaries between 11 - 21 M$$_\odot$$, $$P_{\rm orb} =$$ 25 - 35 days, aim at
  studying stable case B of mass-transfer (MT). Companion is a compact-object with $q =$ 0.8 (fixed)

## 3. Comparison between single vs binary models

![Figure 1](/images/laplace2021-figure1.png)

* Point C (half of core-He burning): no H-rich shell in binary due to MT. Core of donor in binary is
  cooler but denser, behaves as a the core of a less massive initial star

* Point D (end of core-He burning): larger core mass for single model. Different core C/O ratios. In
  binary model there is a C/O gradient in the edge of the core due to wind mass-loss

* Point E (end of core-C burning): different O/Ne abundances due to different initial conditions and
  $$\rho_{\rm c}$$ and $$T_{\rm c}$$ values

* Point F (end of core-O burning): core composition very different really close to core-collapse

## 4. Differences between single vs binary models

Compare models at core-collapse with same core-masses as explosions are related to core properties

### 4.1 Composition

![Figure 2](/images/laplace2021-figure2.png)

* Region I: binaries have a a C/O gradient, singles don't. Related to convective core shrinking at
  core He burning (mass-loss)

* Region II: similar composition, different abundances. Shell mergers in 4.3 M$$_\odot$$ models.

* Region III: higher mass-fractions of Si around Fe core.


### 4.2 Shell mergers

In some models the layer burning Si merges with an O-rich shell producing more Si, S, Ar and Ca, and
reducing O, Ne, Mg. This Ca is important as it could be used as an observational test.

***Question: Is this merger a numerical artifact due to the prescription used for convection ?***

### 4.3 Final total massses of isotopes

* Less He in binaries due to winds and MT interactions

* More C in binaries

* Similar O and Fe

### 4.4 Density profiles

![Figure 6](/images/laplace2021-figure6.png)

* Region I (He-rich layer): higher densities in binary models, steeper profile at the outer edge.
  Shallow drop in $$\mu$$ due to the presence of a C/O gradient

* Region II (O-rich layer): small peak in $$\mu$$ conected to Si-rich layer. Large difference in
  densities

For single stars, $$\mu$$ increases in the outer layers thanks to the recombination

### 4.5 He core properties

Larger He core radius in binaries compare to single stars. This radius decreases for higher masses

## 5. Origins of differences

### 5.1 Chemical gradient

In single stars, the grow of the convective core brings new He that favors alpha-captures onto C
thus increasing the mass fraction of O. The exact opposite happens the donor of a binary where
instead there is a decrease in size of the convective core due to stellar winds. This receding
core is also responsible for the C/O gradient found in binary models just outside the He-depleted
core

There is also a difference in the density and $$\mu$$ profile between the star and binary models
mostly found outside the He-depleted core, related to the presence (or absence) of the C/O gradient

### 5.2 Final total isotope masses

Related to the rates of $$\alpha$$-captures and triple-$$\alpha$$ reaction after core-He burning,
i.e., shell He burning and so on

### 5.3 Shell burning

![Figure 12](/images/laplace2021-figure12.png)

He rich layer is denser in the binary model, starts after core-He depletion, thus, during the
ignition of He in a shell

![Figure 13](/images/laplace2021-figure13.png)

* Point D (end of core-He burning): in single model there is a H-burning shell and a strong
  He-burning shell. In binary, no H shell and faint He-burning shell

* Point E (end of core-C burning): extended He-burning shell in binary, but weaker in power than
  for the single model. In binary model, there is more C which in turn introduces more
  $$\alpha$$-captures (exactly the opposite to what happens in core-He burning)

* Point F (end of core-O burning): C-burning shell location is different due to an increment
  in the C mass fraction for the binary model which allows this layer to ignite further out

Defining the mass of the future compact-object as the mass inside the star with an specific
entropy below 4 erg g$$^{-1}$$ K$$^{-1}$$, they derive a compact object mass of 1.83 M$$_\odot$$
for the single model and 1.9 M$$_\odot$$ for the binary

### 5.4 Compactness evolution

![Figure 14](/images/laplace2021-figure14.png)

At core-collapse, binary models have lower compactness values than single stars with the same
initial mass, but these numbers are similar when comparing similar core masses.

## Discussion

* Due to the differences in the compactness of stars with the same initial masses but in single
  and binary models, binaries might explore more easily (though, based on pure He stars, this
  has not been found in multi-D simulations). But considering the changes in the interior
  profiles, this might hint for a change in this

* Composition is certainly different in single and binary models. This can lead to different
  nucleosynthesis in the supernova stage which can be observed, e.g., during the nebular stage
  by measuring O lines (used to derived an estimation of the pre core-collapse masses of the
  stars)

* Wind-mass loss, responsible for the C/O gradient outside the He-depleted core of binaries, is
  highly uncertain and can, in principle, affect both the core composition at late stages and
  the density structure pre-supernova. Have implications in the derived core masses and, with
  it, in the compact object masses

* Convection and shell mergers still debated. Changes abundances in the star, so nucleosynthesis
  at supernova is affected by it
