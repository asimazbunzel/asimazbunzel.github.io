We explore various stellar parameters which produce low-mass binary black-holes. These binaries
were first detected by the gravitational waves interferometers of LIGO and Virgo !

*A GitHub repository contains all the source code to produce the raw data as well as scripts to
reproduce all the figures in the manuscript. I strongly support a reproducible science approach*
