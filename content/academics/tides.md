An interesting topic regarding the role of tides (like the ones acting on the oceans due to the
moon and the earth not being a solid body) on binaries containing a common-type star and a
compact-object (neutron star or black hole). it turns out, they are very important in predicting a
lot of stellar (and binary) parameters !

*A GitHub repository contains all the source code to produce the raw data as well as scripts to
reproduce all the figures in the manuscript. I strongly support a reproducible science approach*
