In this work, we explore a large set of stellar-evolution models aim at
reproducing current measurements of this very rare binary. special attention is put on the
core-collapse and the assymetries happening at that moment as it seems they are needed to explain
what the binary looks nowadays.

*A GitHub repository contains all the source code to produce the raw data as well as scripts to
reproduce all the figures in the manuscript. I strongly support a reproducible science approach*
