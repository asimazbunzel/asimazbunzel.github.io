I have participated in several other works:

> [A catalogue of high-mass X-ray binaries in the Galaxy: from the INTEGRAL to the Gaia era](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230202656F/abstract) >> This is an online catalog of high-mass
X-ray binaries with the advantage over previous ones in that it is actively maintained by a team
using GitHub pages.

> [Interaction of a high-mass X-ray binary with the interstellar medium through stellar wind. The case of GX 301-2](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221206623M/abstract) >> My contribution
in this work is related to the stellar-evolution model of a progenitor for the binary. Here the
focus is set on the contribution of the high-mass X-ray binary to pollute the medium with gas to
trigger stellar formation.

> [Constraints to neutron-star kicks in high-mass X-ray binaries with Gaia EDR3](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...665A..31F/abstract) >> Statistical study of natal kicks produced during
the end point in the stellar-evolution of massive stars in progenitors of high-mass X-ray binaries.
Interesingly, we find a more complex distribution for the natal kicks produced due to the
assymetries, than those find in isolated pulsars !

> [SN 2013ai: A Link between Hydrogen-rich and Hydrogen-poor Core-collapse Supernovae](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909..145D/abstract) >> My contribution included a stellar-evolution
model for the progenitor system. The work is much more complete with lots of analysis of
observational data !

> [Confirmation of glitch event observed in PSR J0742-2822 at the Argentine Institute of Radioastronomy (IAR)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ATel15638....1Z/abstract) >> Astronomy telegram
with a glitch event of a known pulsar. Data taken from @IAR !

> [PSR J0437-4715: The Argentine Institute of Radioastronomy 2019-2020 Observational Campaign](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..158S/abstract) >> Analysis of radio observations taken
with the two (radio) telescopes located @IAR (my workplace !)
