Hi ! I'm Adolfo, an astronomer and PhD student from Argentina

**Stellar evolution of massive binaries**

The main topic of my research as a student involves the study of the binary evolution of progenitors of double compact
objects which are the sources of gravitational waves that the LIGO/Virgo collaboration is currently detecting

**Final stages of stellar evolution**

I am also interested in the study of powerful transients connected to the end points of stellar evolution of massive stars,
such as Supernovae. In addition to this, its role is extremely important for progenitors of gravitational waves as
asymmetries happening during this transient phenomena can change the parameters of the binary

**Technology misc**

Apart from science, I like to code on my free time whatever I feel like. Most of the things I code can be found in my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/asimazbunzel)
