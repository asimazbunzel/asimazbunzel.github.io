We use the publicly-available 1D-hydrodynamic stellar-evolution code MESA, which we adapted to
include the black-hole formation and the unstable mass transfer developed during the so-called
common-envelope phase. Using more than 60$$\,$$000 binary simulations, we explore a wide parameter
space for initial stellar masses, separations, metallicities and mass-transfer efficiencies.
We obtain the expected distributions for the chirp mass, mass ratio and merger time delay by
accounting for the initial stellar binary distributions. We predict the expected merger rates
that we compare with the detected gravitational-wave events, and study the dependence of our
predictions with respect to (yet) unconstrained parameters inherent to binary stellar evolution.
