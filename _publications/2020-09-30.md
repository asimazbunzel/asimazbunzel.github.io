The Argentine Institute of Radio astronomy (IAR) is equipped with two single-dish 30-m radio
antennas capable of performing daily observations of pulsars and radio transients in the southern
hemisphere at 1.4 GHz. We aim to contribute to pulsar timing studies related to short time-scale
interstellar scintillation and searches for sources of continuous gravitational waves. We performed
high-cadence (almost daily) and long-duration observations of the bright millisecond pulsar
J0437$$−$$4715 for over a year, gathering more than 700 hours of good-quality data with timing
precision better than 1 $$\mu$$s. We characterize the white and red timing noise in IAR's
observations of J0437$$−$$4715. We quantify the effects of scintillation in this data set and
perform single pulsar searches of continuous gravitational waves, setting constraints in the
nHz$$-$$ $$\mu$$Hz frequency range. We demonstrate IAR's potential for performing pulsar monitoring
in the 1.4 GHz radio band for long periods of time with a daily cadence. In particular, we conclude
that the ongoing observational campaign of the millisecond pulsar J0437$$−$$4715 can contribute to
increase the sensitivity of the existing pulsar timing arrays.
