I am a PhD student at the University of La Plata, Argentina, working
in the Instituto Argentino de Radioastronomia
([IAR](https://www.iar.unlp.edu.ar/))
and a member of the [GARRA group](http://garra.iar.unlp.edu.ar/).

### Stellar evolution of massive binaries towards double compact object formation

The main topic of my research involves the study of the binary evolution of progenitors of double
compact objects which are the sources of gravitational-waves that the LIGO/Virgo collaboration is
currently detecting.

### Stellar evolution and core-collapse stages

I am also interested in the study of transient events such as Supernovae and how they proceed. For that I am
collaborating with the SOS group of the FCAGLP (@ UNLP) which specialize in the modelling and observations of
any type of core-collapse Supernovae. I am also collaborating with the French group @ CEA SACLAY to study the
details of core-collapse and natal-kicks onto compact objects using 3D models.
